              The tree of my title is not a green tree with leaves. It is the
              name of an abstract structure. I shall contrast it with another,
              more complex abstract structure called a semilattice. In order to
              relate these abstract structures to the nature of the city, I must
              first make a simple distinction.<br />
              <br />I want to call those cities which have arisen more or less
              spontaneously over many, many years natural cities. And I shall
              call those cities and parts of cities which have been deliberately
              created by designers and planners artificial cities.

              Siena, Liverpool, Kyoto, Manhattan are examples of natural cities.
              Levittown, Chandigarh and the British New Towns are examples of
              artificial cities. It is more and more widely recognized today
              that there is some essential ingredient missing from artificial
              cities. When compared with ancient cities that have acquired the
              patina of life, our modern attempts to create cities artificially
              are, from a human point of view, entirely unsuccessful.
              <br /><br />Both the tree and the semilattice are ways of thinking
              about how a large collection of many small systems goes to make up
              a large and complex system. More generally, they are both names
              for structures of sets.

            <p id="bodytext">
              In order to define such structures, let me first define the
              concept of a set. A set is a collection of elements which for some
              reason we think of as belonging together. Since, as designers, we
              are concerned with the physical living city and its physical
              backbone, we must naturally restrict ourselves to considering sets
              which are collections of material elements such as people, blades
              of grass, cars, molecules, houses, gardens, water pipes, the water
              molecules in them etc <br /><br />When the elements of a set
              belong together because they co-operate or work together somehow,
              we call the set of elements a system. <br /><br />For example, in
              Berkeley at the corner of Hearst and Euclid, there is a drugstore,
              and outside the drugstore a traffic light. In the entrance to the
              drugstore there is a newsrack where the day’s papers are
              displayed. When the light is red, people who are waiting to cross
              the street stand idly by the light; and since they have nothing to
              do, they look at the papers displayed on the newsrack which they
              can see from where they stand. Some of them just read the
              headlines, others actually buy a paper while they wait.<br /><br />
              This effect makes the newsrack and the traffic light interactive;
              the newsrack, the newspapers on it, the money going from people’s
              pockets to the dime slot, the people who stop at the light and
              read papers, the traffic light, the electric impulses which make
              the lights change, and the sidewalk which the people stand on form
              a system - they all work together.<br /><br />
              From the designer’s point of view, the physically unchanging part
              of this system is of special interest. The newsrack, the traffic
              light and the sidewalk between them, related as they are, form the
              fixed part of the system. It is the unchanging receptacle in which
              the changing parts of the system - people, newspapers, money and
              electrical impulses - can work together. I define this fixed part
              as a unit of the city. It derives its coherence as a unit both
              from the forces which hold its own elements together and from the
              dynamic coherence of the larger living system which includes it as
              a fixed invariant part.<br /><br />
              Of the many, many fixed concrete subsets of the city which are the
              receptacles for its systems and can therefore be thought of as
              significant physical units, we usually single out a few for
              special consideration. In fact, I claim that whatever picture of
              the city someone has is defined precisely by the subsets he sees
              as units.<br /><br />
              Now, a collection of subsets which goes to make up such a picture
              is not merely an amorphous collection. Automatically, merely
              because relationships are established among the subsets once the
              subsets are chosen, the collection has a definite structure. To
              understand this structure, let us think abstractly for a moment,
              using numbers as symbols. Instead of talking about the real sets
              of millions of real particles which occur in the city, let us
              consider a simpler structure made of just half a dozen elements.
              Label these elements 1,2,3,4,5,6. Not including the full set
              [1,2,3,4,5,6], the empty set [-], and the one-element sets
              [1],[2],[3],C4],[5],[6], there are 56 different subsets we can
              pick from six elements.<br /><br />
              Suppose we now pick out certain of these 56 sets (just as we pick
              out certain sets and call them units when we form our picture of
              the city). Let us say, for example, that we pick the following
              subsets: [123], [34], [45], [234], [345], [12345], [3456].<br /><br />
              What are the possible relationships among these sets? Some sets
              will be entirely part of larger sets, as [34] is part of [345] and
              [3456]. Some of the sets will overlap, like [123] and [234]. Some
              of the sets will be disjoint - that is, contain no elements in
              common like [123] and [45].

                Diagrams A&B We can see these relationships displayed in two
                ways. In diagram A each set chosen to be a unit has a line drawn
                round it. In diagram B the chosen sets are arranged in order of
                ascending magnitude, so that whenever one set contains another
                (as [345] contains [34], there is a vertical path leading from
                one to the other. For the sake of clarity and visual economy, it
                is usual to draw lines only between sets which have no further
                sets and lines between them; thus the line between [34] and
                [345] and the line between [345] and [3456] make it unnecessary
                to to draw a line between [34]and [3456].

                Whenever one set contains another (as [345] contains [34], there
                is a vertical path leading from one to the other. For the sake
                of clarity and visual economy, it is usual to draw lines only
                between sets which have no further sets and lines between them;
                thus the line between [34] and [345] and the line between [345]
                and [3456] make it unnecessary to to draw a line between [34]and
                [3456].

              As we see from these two represen-tations, the choice of subsets
              alone endows the collection of subsets as a whole with an overall
              structure. This is the structure which we are concerned with here.
              When the structure meets certain conditions it is called a
              semilattice. When it meets other more restrictive conditions, it
              is called a tree. <br /><br />The structure illustrated in
              diagrams A and B is a semilattice. It satisfies the axiom since,
              for instance, [234] and [345] both belong to the collection and
              their common part, [34], also belongs to it. (As far as the city
              is concerned, this axiom states merely that wherever two units
              overlap, the area of overlap is itself a recognizable entity and
              hence a unit also. In the case of the drugstore example, one unit
              consists of newsrack, sidewalk and traffic light. Another unit
              consists of the drugstore itself, with its entry and the newsrack.
              The two units overlap in the newsrack. Clearly this area of
              overlap is itself a recognizable unit and so satisfies the axiom
              above which defines the characteristics of a semilattice.) The
              tree axiom states: A collection of sets forms a tree if and only
              if, for any two sets that belong to the collection either one is
              wholly contained in the other, or else they are wholly disjoint.
              <br /><br />However, in this chapter we are not so much concerned
              with the fact that a tree happens to be a semilattice, but with
              the difference between trees and those more general semilattices
              which are not trees because they do contain overlapping units. We
              are concerned with the difference between structures in which no
              overlap occurs, and those structures in which overlap does occur.
              It is not merely the overlap which makes the distinction between
              the two important. Still more important is the fact that the
              semilattice is potentially a much more complex and subtle
              structure than a tree. We may see just how much more complex a
              semilattice can be than a tree in the following fact: a tree based
              on 20 elements can contain at most 19 further subsets of the 20,
              while a semilattice based on the same 20 elements can contain more
              than 1,000,000 different subsets. This enormously greater variety
              is an index of the great structural complexity a semilattice can
              have when compared with the structural simplicity of a tree. It is
              this lack of structural complexity, characteristic of trees, which
              is crippling our conceptions of the city. To demonstrate, let us
              look at some modern conceptions of the city, each of which I shall
              show to be essentially a tree.

                The semilattice axiom goes like this: A collection of sets forms
                a semilattice ifand only if, when two overlapping sets belong to
                the collection, the set of elements common to both also belongs
                to the collection.

                Abercrombie and Forshaw: The drawing depicts the structure
                conceived by Abercrombie for London. It is made of a large
                number of communities, each sharply separated from all adjacent
                communities. Abercrombie writes, ‘The proposal is to emphasize
                the identity of the existing communities, to increase their
                degree of segregation, and where necessary to recognize them as
                separate and definite entities.’ And again, ‘The communities
                themselves consist of a series of sub-units, generally with
                their own shops and schools, corresponding to the neighbourhood
                units.’ The city is conceived as a tree with two principal
                levels. The communities are the larger units of the structure;
                the smaller sub-units are neighbourhoods. There are no
                overlapping units. The structure is a tree.

                The organic shapes of Mesa City lead us, at a careless glance,
                to believe that it is a richer structure than our more obviously
                rigid examples. But when we look at it in detail we find
                precisely the same principle of organization. Take,
                particularly, the university centre. Here we find the centre of
                the city divided into a university and a residential quarter,
                which is itself divided into a number of villages (actually
                apartment towers) for 4000 inhabitants, each again subdivided
                further and surrounded by groups of still smaller dwelling
                units.

                which are residential neighbourhoods, except in the third major
                loop where one contains government offices and another
                industrial offices.

                Communitas is explicitly organized as a tree: it is first
                divided into four concentric major zones, the innermost being a
                commercial centre, the next a university, the third residential
                and medical, and the fourth open country. Each of these is
                further subdivided: the commercial centre is represented as a
                great cylindrical skyscraper, containing five layers: airport,
                administration, light manufacture, shopping and amusement; and,
                at the bottom, railroads, buses and mechanical services. The
                university is divided into eight sectors comprising natural
                history, zoos and aquariums, planetarium, science laboratories,
                plastic arts, music and drama. The third concentric ring is
                divided into neighbourhoods of 4000 people each, not consisting
                of individual houses, but of apartment blocks, each of these
                containing individual dwelling units. Finally, the open country
                is divided into three segments: forestpreserves, agriculture and
                vacation lands. The overall organization is a tree.

                The most beautiful example of all I have kept until last,
                because it symbolizes the problem perfectly. It appears in
                Hilberseimer’s book The Nature of Cities. He describes the fact
                that certain Roman towns had their origin as military camps, and
                then shows a picture of a modern military encampment as a kind
                of archetypal form for the city. It is not possible to have a
                structure which is a clearer tree. The symbol is apt, for, of
                course, the organization of the army was designed precisely in
                order to create discipline and rigidity. The photograph on the
                [right] is Hilberseimer’s own scheme for the commercial area of
                a city based on the army camp archetype.

              In the natural city, even the house on a long street (not in some
              little cluster) is a more accurate acknowledgement of the fact
              that your friends live not next door, but far away, and can only
              be reached by bus or car. In this respect Manhattan has more
              overlap in it than Greenbelt. And though one can argue that in
              Greenbelt, too, friends are only minutes away by car, one must
              then ask: since certain groups have been emphasized by the
              physical units of the physical structure, why are just these the
              most irrelevant ones? The units of which an artificial city is
              made up are always organized to form a tree. So that we get a
              really clear understanding of what this means, and shall better
              see its implications, let us define a tree once again. Whenever we
              have a tree structure, it means that within this structure no
              piece of any unit is ever connected to other units, except through
              the medium of that unit as a whole. The enormity of this
              restriction is difficult to grasp. It is a little as though the
              members of a family were not free to make friends outside the
              family, except when the family as a whole made a friendship. In
              simplicity of structure the tree is comparable to the compulsive
              desire for neatness and order that insists the candlesticks on a
              mantelpiece be perfectly straight and perfectly symmetrical about
              the centre. The semilattice, by comparison, is the structure of a
              complex fabric; it is the structure of living things, of great
              paintings and symphonies. It must be emphasized, lest the orderly
              mind shrink in horror from anything that is not clearly
              articulated and categorized in tree form, that the idea of
              overlap, ambiguity, multiplicity of aspect and the semilattice are
              not less orderly than the rigid tree, but more so. They represent
              a thicker, tougher, more subtle and more complex view of
              structure. Let us now look at the ways in which the natural, when
              unconstrained by artificial conceptions, shows itself to be a
              semilattice. A major aspect of the city’s social structure which a
              tree can never mirror properly is illustrated by Ruth Glass’s
              redevelopment plan for Middlesbrough, England, a city of 200,000
              which she recommends be broken down into 29 separate
              neighbourhoods. After picking her 29 neighbourhoods by determining
              where the sharpest discontinuities of building type, income and
              job type occur, she asks herself the question: ‘If we examine some
              of the social systems which actually exist for the people in such
              a neighbourhood, do the physical units defined by these various
              social systems all define the same spatial neighbourhood?’ Her own
              answer to this question is no. Each of the social systems she
              examines is a nodal system. It is made of some sort of central
              node, plus the people who use this centre. Specifically she takes
              elementary

              <div id="info">
                Each of these structures, then, is a tree. Each unit in each
                tree that I have described, moreover, is the fixed, unchanging
                residue of some system in the living city (just as a house is
                the residue of the interactions between the members of a family,
                their emotions and their belongings; and a freeway is the
                residue of movement and commercial exchange). However, in every
                city there are thousands, even millions, of times as many more
                systems at work whose physical residue does not appear as a unit
                in these tree structures. In the worst cases, the units which do
                appear fail to correspond to any living reality; and the real
                systems, whose existence actually makes the city live, have been
                provided with no physical receptacle. Neither the Columbia plan
                nor the Stein plan for example, corresponds to social realities.
                The physical layout of the plans, and the way they function
                suggests a hierarchy of stronger and stronger closed social
                groups, ranging from the whole city down to the family, each
                formed by associational ties of different strength.

                In a traditional society, if we ask a man to name his best
                friends and then ask each of these in turn to name their best
                friends, they will all name each other so that they form a
                closed group. A village is made up of a number of separate
                closed groups of this kind. But today’s social structure is
                utterly different. If we ask a man to name his friends and then
                ask them in turn to name their friends, they will all name
                different people, very likely unknown to the first person; these
                people would again name others, and so on outwards. There are
                virtually no closed groups of people in modern society. The
                reality of today’s social structure is thick with overlap - the
                systems of friends and acquaintances form a semilattice, not a
                tree.

              schools, secondary schools, youth clubs, adult clubs, post
              offices, greengrocers and grocers selling sugar. Each of these
              centres draws its users from a certain spatial area or spatial
              unit. This spatial unit is the physical residue of the social
              system as a whole, and is therefore a unit in the terms of this
              discussion. The units corresponding to different kinds of centres
              for the single neighbourhood of Waterloo Road are shown in Figure
              11. We cannot get an adequate picture of what Middlesbrough is, or
              of what it ought to be, in terms of 29 large and conveniently
              integral Chunks called neighbourhoods. When we describe the city
              in terms of neighbourhoods, we implicitly assume that the smaller
              elements within any one of these neighbourhoods belong together so
              tightly that they only interact with elements in other
              neighbourhoods through the medium of the neighbourhoods to which
              they themselves belong. Ruth Glass herself shows clearly that this
              is not the case. There is nothing in the nature of the various
              centres which says that their catchment areas should be the same.
              Their natures are different. Therefore 13 the units they define
              are different.The natural city of Middlesbrough was faithful to
              the semilattice structure of the units. Only in the
              artificial-tree conception of the city are their natural, proper
              and necessary overlaps destroyed.

                The white circle stands for the youth club, and the small solid
                rings stand for areas where its members live. The ringed spot is
                the adult club, and the homes of its members form the unit
                marked by dashed boundaries. The white square is the post
                office, and the dotted line marks the unit which contains its
                users. The secondary school is marked by the spot with a white
                triangle in it. Together with its pupils, it forms the system
                marked by the dot-dashed line. As you can see at once, the
                different units do not coincide. Yet neither are they disjoint.
                They overlap. Next to Figure 11 are two representations of the
                Waterloo neighbourhood. For the sake of argument I have broken
                it into a number of small areas. Figure 12 shows how these
                pieces stick together in fact, and Figure 13 shows how the
                redevelopment plan pretends they stick together.

              Another·favourite concept of the CIAM theorists and others is the separation of recreation from everything else. This has crystallized in our real cities in the form of playgrounds. The playground, asphalted and fenced in, is nothing but a pictorial acknowledgment of the fact that 'play' exists as an isolated concept in our minds. It has nothing to do with the life of play itself. Few self-respecting children will even play in a playground.

Play itself, the play that children practise, goes on somewhere different every day. One day it may be indoors, another day in a friendly gas station, another day down by the river, another day in a derelict building, another day on a construction site which has been abandoned for the weekend. Each of these play activities, and the objects it requires, forms a system. It is not true that these systems exist in isolation, cut off from the other systems of the city. The different systems overlap one another, and they overlap many other systems besides. The units, the physical places recognized as play places, must do the same.

In a natural city this is what happens. Play takes place in a thousand places it fills the interstices of adult life. As they play, children become full of their surroundings. How can children become filled with their surroundings in a fenced enclosure! They cannot. 

A similar kind of mistake occurs in trees like that of Goodman’s Communitas or Soleri’s Mesa City, which separate the university from the rest of the city. Again, this has actually been realized in the common American form of the isolated campus.

What is the reason for drawing a line in the city so that everything within the boundary is university, and everything outside is nonuniversity? It is conceptually clear. But does it correspond to the realities of university life? Certainly it is not the structure which occurs in nonartificial university cities.

                Separation of pedestrians from moving vehicles
              </div>
              <div id="info">
              	Consider the separation of pedestrians from moving vehicles, a tree concept proposed by Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn and many others. At a very crude level of thought this is obviously a good idea. Yet the urban taxi can function only because pedestrians and vehicles are not strictly separated. The cruising taxi needs a fast stream of traffic so that it can cover a large area to be sure of finding a passenger. The pedestrian needs to be able to hail the taxi from any point in the pedestrian world, and to be able to get out to any part of the pedestrian world to which he wants to go. The system which contains the taxicabs needs to overlap both the fast vehicular traffic system and the system of pedestrian circulation. In Manhattan pedestrians and vehicles do share certain parts of the city, and the necessary overlap is guaranteed (Figure 14).

            <div id="info">
There are always many systems of activity where university life and city life overlap: pub-crawling, coffee-drinking, the movies, walking from place to place. In some cases whole departments may be actively involved in the life of the city’s inhabitants (the hospital-cum-medical school is an example). In Cambridge, a natural city where university and city have grown together gradually, the physical units overlap because they are the physical residues of city systems and university systems which overlap

            <p id="bodytext">Let us look next at the hierarchy of urban cores realized in Brasilia, Chandigarh, the MARS plan for London and, most recently, in the Manhattan Lincoln Center, where various performing arts serving the population of greater New York have been gathered together to form just one core.

              Does a concert hall ask to be next to an opera house? Can the two feed on one another? Will anybody ever visit them both, gluttonously, in a single evening, or even buy tickets from one after going to a performance in the other? In Vienna, London, Paris, each of the performing arts has found its own place, because all are not mixed randomly. Each has created its own familiar section of the city. In Manhattan itself, Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera House were not built side by side. Each found its own place, and now creates its own atmosphere. The influence of each overlaps the parts of the city which have been made unique to it.
              
              The only reason that these functions have all been brought together in Lincoln Center is that the concept of performing art links them to one another. 
              
              But this tree, and the idea of a single hierarchy of urban cores which is its\ parent, do not illuminate the relations between art and city life. They are merely born of the mania every simple-minded person has for putting things with the same name into the same basket.
              
              The total separation of work from housing, started by Tony Garnier in his industrial city, then incorporated in the 1929 Athens Charter, is now found in every artificial city and accepted everywhere where zoning is enforced. Is this a sound principle? It is easy to see how bad conditions at the beginning of the century prompted planners to try to get the dirty factories out of residential areas. But the separation misses a variety of systems which require, for their sustenance, little parts of both.
              
              Finally, let us examine the subdivision of the city into isolated communities. As we have seen in the Abercrombie plan for London, this is itself a tree structure. The individual community in a greater city has no reality as a functioning unit.
              In London, as in any great city, almost no one manages to find work which suits him near his home. People in one community work in a factory which is very likely to be in another community
              
              There are therefore many hundreds of thousands of worker-workplace systems, each consisting of individuals plus the factory they work in, which cut across the boundaries defined by Abercrombie’s tree. The existence of these units, and their overlapping nature, indicates that the living systems of London form a semilattice. Only in the planner’s mind has it become a tree.
              
              The fact that we have so far failed to give this any physical expression has a vital consequence. As things are, whenever the worker and his workplace belong to separately administered municipalities, the community which contains the workplace collects huge taxes and has relatively little on which to spend the tax revenue. The community where the worker lives, if it is mainly residential, collects only little in the way of taxes and yet has great additional burdens on its purse in the form of schools, hospitals, etc. Clearly, to resolve this inequity, the worker-workplace systems must be anchored in physically recognizable units of the city which can then be taxed.
              
              It might be argued that, even though the individual communities of a great city have no functional significance in the lives of their inhabitants, they are still the most convenient administrative units, and should therefore be left in their present tree organization. However, in the political complexity of a modern city, even this is suspect.
              
              Edward Banfield, in his book Political Influence, gives a detailed account of the patterns of influence and control that have actually led to decisions in Chicago. He shows that, although the lines of administrative and executive control have a formal structure which is a tree, these formal chains of influence and authority are entirely overshadowed by the ad hoc lines of control which arise naturally as each new city problem presents itself. These ad hoc lines depend on who is interested in the matter, who has what at stake, who has what favours to trade with whom.
              
              This second structure, which is informal, working within the framework of the first, is what really controls public action. It varies from week to week, even from hour to hour, as one problem replaces another. Nobody’s sphere of influence is entirely under the control of any one superior; each person is under different influences as the problems change. Although the organization chart in the Mayor’s office is a tree, the actual control and exercise of authority is semilattice-like.
              
              Now, why is it that so many designers have conceived cities as trees when the natural structure is in every case a semilattice? Have they done so deliberately, in the belief that a tree structure will serve the people of the city better? Or have they done it because they cannot help it, because they are trapped by a mental habit, perhaps even trapped by the way the mind works - because they cannot encompass the complexity of a semilattice in any convenient mental form, because the mind has an overwhelming predisposition to see trees wherever it looks and cannot escape the tree conception?
              
              I shall try to convince you that it is for this second reason that trees are being proposed and built as cities - that is, because designers, limited as they must be by the capacity of the mind to form intuitively accessible structures, cannot achieve the complexity of the semilattice in a single mental act. Let me begin with an example. Suppose I ask you to remember the following
              four objects: an orange, a watermelon, a football and a tennis ball. How will you keep them in your mind, in your mind’s eye? However you do it, you will do it by grouping them. Some of you will take the two fruits together, the orange and the watermelon, and the two sports balls together, the football and the tennis ball. Those of you who tend to think in terms of physical shape may group them differently, taking the two small spheres together - the orange and the tennis ball and the two large and more egg-shaped objects - the watermelon and the football. Some of you will be aware of both.

              This is the problem we face as designers. While we are not, perhaps, necessarily occupied with the problem of total visualization in a single mental act, the principle is still the same. The tree is accessible mentally and easy to deal with. The semilattice is hard to keep before the mind’s eye and therefore hard to deal with. 

              It is known today that grouping and categorization are among the most primitive psychological processes. Modern psychology treats thought as a process of fitting new situations into existing slots and pigeonholes in the mind. Just as you cannot put a physical thing into more than one physical pigeonhole at once, so, by analogy, the processes of thought prevent you from putting a mental construct into more than one mental category at once. Study of the origin of these processes suggests that they stem essentially from the organism’s need to reduce the complexity of its environment by establishing barriers between the different events that it encounters.
              
              It is for this reason - because the mind’s first function is to reduce the ambiguity and overlap in a confusing situation and because, to this end, it is endowed with a basic intolerance for ambiguity - that structures like the city, which do require overlapping sets within them, are nevertheless persistently conceived as trees. 
              
              The same rigidity dogs even perception of physical patterns. In experiments by Huggins and myself at Harvard, we showed people patterns whose internal units overlapped, and found that they almost always invent a way of seeing the patterns as a tree - even when the semilattice view of the patterns would have helped them perform the task of experimentation which was before them.

              	Let us make a diagram of these groupings (Figure 16). Either grouping taken by itself is a tree structure. The
two together are a semilattice. Now let us try and visualize these groupings in the mind's eye. I think you will find that you cannot visualize all four sets simultaneously - because they overlap.

              You can visualize one pair of sets and then the other, and you can alternate between the two pairs extremely fast, so that you may deceive yourself into thinking you can visualize them all together. But in truth, you cannot conceive all four sets at once in a single mental act. You cannot bring the semilattice structure into a visualizable form for a single mental act. In a single mental act you can only visualize a tree.

            <p id="bodytext">These experiments suggest strongly that people have an underlying tendency, when faced by a complex organization, to reorganize it mentally in terms of non-overlapping units. The complexity of the semilattice is replaced by the simpler and more easily grasped tree form. 

              You are no doubt wondering by now what a city looks like which is a semilattice, but not a tree. I must confess that I cannot yet show you plans or sketches. It is not enough merely to make a demonstration of overlap - the overlap must be the right overlap. This is doubly important because it is so tempting to make plans in which overlap occurs for its own sake. This is essentially what the high- density ‘life-filled’ city plans of recent years do. But overlap alone does not give structure. It can also give chaos. A garbage can is full of overlap. To have structure, you must have the right overlap, and this is for us almost certainly different from the old overlap which we observe in historic cities. As the relationships between functions change, so the systems which need to overlap in order to receive these relationships must also change. The recreation of old kinds of overlap will be inappropriate, and chaotic instead of structured.  </p>

The most startling proof that people tend to conceive even physical patterns as trees is found in some experiments of Sir Frederick Bartlett. He showed people a pattern for about a quarter of a second and then asked them to draw what they had seen. Many people, unable to grasp the full complexity of the pattern they had seen, simplified the patterns by cutting 19 out the overlap. In Figure 17, the original is shown on the left, with two fairly typical redrawn versions to the right of it. In the redrawn versions the circles are separated from the rest; the overlap between triangles and circles disappears.
